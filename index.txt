algorithm to determine the length of the sentence:

start
get the sentence='this is my checkpoint project.'
get a variable length=0
count the number of characters in sentence
for each count let length=length+1
end the count at period
get the final value of length
end

algorithm to determine the number of words in the sentence:

start
get the sentence='this is my checkpoint project.'
get a variable word=0
count the number of words in sentence
for each count let word=word+1
end the count at the period
get the final value of word
end

algorithm to determine the number of vowels in the sentence:

start
get the sentence='this is my checkpoint project.'
get a variable each=0
get a variable vowels=a,e,i,o,u
count the number of vowels in sentence
for each count let each=each+1
end count at the period
get the final value of each
end
